# GsearchGmaps

Small Google Chrome extension to make maps search result clickable #DMA

# Context

DMA forced Google to remove the link to Google Maps from search results.

Maps are now static -- why not -- but not clickable. There is only a "directions" button.

# First release

This first release of the extension adds a link to Google Maps to the static map.

# Future release

A future release might be to replace the map with the embedded dynamic map.

# How to install

* Click Code -> Download ZIP
* Unpack to your favorite location
* Goto to Google Chrome extensions management
* Click "Load unpacked extension" and point to the folder where you extracted the ZIP file

# Privacy

The extension does not collect any data. The search query is only used to compose a maps URL.
