# GsearchGmaps

Small Google Chrome extension to make maps search result clickable #DMA

# Context

DMA forced Google to remove the link to Google Maps from search results.

Maps are now static -- why not -- but not clickable. There is only a "directions" button.

# First release

This first release of the extension adds a link to Google Maps to the static map.

# Future release

A future release might be to replace the map with the embedded dynamic map.
